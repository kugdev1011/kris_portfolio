## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
This is the official open source repository of my personal portfolio website. 

⚡️ It is built on the latest technologies, trying to put together as much of what I have learned into practice.\
⚡️ It features some of my github projects as well.\
⚡️ It is fully responsive & user friendly website.\
⚡️ It supports both dark mode and light mode.\
⚡️ It has five sections like Home, About, Skills, Projects & Contact.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites** :

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your machine:

- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) with the npm package manager.
- Recommended Versions of them are -

  ```
  node v16.20.2 or higher
  npm v8.19.4 or higher
  git v2.30.1 or higher
  ```

### **Starting React Dev Server** :

1. Download or clone the code from this repository. If you download as a zip file, be sure to unzip it.

2. Navigate to the My-Portfolio folder, there should be a package.json file in this folder.

3. In a command window (or the Command prompt in VS Code), type below command.

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This creates a **node_modules** folder and installs all packages from the package.json file into that folder. You may see a few warnings during this process, but you should not see any errors.

4. In the same command window (or the Command prompt in VS Code), type

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application should then run successfully and you should see a message like **" VITE v4.x.x ready in xxx ms Local: http://localhost:5173/"**.

5. Open **http://localhost:5173** to view it in the browser.
